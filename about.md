My name is Harlan Lieberman-Berg, and this is the place that I cajole, curse, muse, proselytize, rant, or some combination of the above.  Currently, I'm working for [AdvertiSin](http://www.advertisin.com), an early-stage start-up that I founded to bring the real-time bidding revolution to the adult entertainment industry.  Previously, I've worked as an engineering and operations manager at [Chitika](http://www.chitika.com), among other positions that I've held there.  I'm a career systems administrator, and I'm still active here and there helping different people keep their production and development systems up and humming.

In the free software world, I'm a [paultag](http://notes.pault.ag) acolyte and Debian Maintainer, helping out with a handful of different packages, most of which from my work on the [pkg-perl](http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/) team.  Formerly, I was the head of kernel security for [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org) and a member of their security team.  I also contribute, mostly in very small ways, to a variety of other F/OSS projects, including [Ansible](http://www.github.com/ansible/ansible), [cberl](http://www.github.com/chitika/cberl), [nanomsg](http://www.nanomsg.org), and [poolboy](http://www.github.com/devinus/poolboy).  I can be found lurking in various IRC channels on Freenode and OFTC, with topics ranging from cryptography to wireless mesh networking.

This is a place for me to discuss whatever is on my mind, mainly with a bent towards interesting things that I'm working on or thinking about in the technical or political sphere.  I may occasionally delve into more personal matters, but for the most part, I'm expecting to keep that to a minimum.  This will be the first time I've regularly kept a blog, nevertheless one under a strict, [Iron Blogger](http://boston.iron-blogger.com/pages/home/) enforced schedule, so we will have to see what it ends up being about.  If you're looking to get in touch with me, I'm on IRC (active or not) around the clock as hlieberman and check [my email](mailto:H.LiebermanBerg@gmail.com) with a probably unhealthy frequency.  If you want to reach me by secure means, my GPG key (4096R/0x88237A6A53AB1B2E) can be found on [SKS Keyservers](https://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x88237A6A53AB1B2E) with the fingerprint 43DF 758C 18C7 545A 3E1A  4F0A 8823 7A6A 53AB 1B2E, and my Jabber has OTR with a fingerprint of 6D376C30 911BC5EB 071DAAAE 77F8EC2A C9E88289.
